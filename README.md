## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I am a Fourth year Ph.D. Student at the National University of Singapore, working with Dr. Harold Soh at the CLeAR Lab.

Research: Iâ€™m generally interested in Human-Robot Interaction, Explainable AI, and Robot Foundation Models. Currently, I work at the intersection of these fields, specifically, the Synthesis and Evaluation of Social Navigation Algorithms that would aid robots to behave in a context-appropriate and socially-compliant manner around humans.

Previously: In my Masters Thesis at Arizona State University, I worked on Action Model Learning of black-box agents through agent interrogation with Dr. Siddharth Srivastava and before that, I worked on AI agents that learn to generate explanations progressively for planning tasks through inverse reinforcement learning with Dr. Yu (Tony) Zhang.

When Iâ€™m not working on research, you can generally find me either playing some guitar, cooking, sketching, or watching British panel/comedy shows.
